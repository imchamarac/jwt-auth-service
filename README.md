# JWT Auth Service

### Express + TypeScript + Postgres + Password-JWT Boilerplate

This boilerplate project encompasses a range of common requirements for node API development, combining technologies such as Express, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and Password-JWT. The following features are implemented:

-   **Express Server**: Express server is in place with most of reuqired middlewares.
-   **PostgreSQL Integration**: Seamless integration with a PostgreSQL database.
-   **Authentication and Authorization**: Utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with password-based authentication.
-   **Session Management** : Common requirements for session handling are already in place.
-   **View Engine**: View engine with EJS is in place for public and private pages with actions.
-   **CRUD Operations**: Routes to handle Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
-   **Testing**: Includes setups for unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
-   **Documentation**: Features an OpenAPI specification for API documentation.
-   **Swagger UI**: Provides a Swagger UI setup for easy API exploration.
-   **Docker and Docker-Compose**: Docker and Docker-Compose setups for containerization with pm2 for production.
-   **Logging**: Configured Morgan for HTTP logging and Winston for application level logging.

### Usage Scenarios:

-   ### Authentication Service:
    -   Provides API endpoints to handle user authentication + authentication and basic CRUD operations on user which can be extended to fully functioning authentication service.
-   ### Login Portal:
    -   Provides user interfaces for login, registration, and private pages with session management which can be extended to feature rich universal login platorm.

Feel free to use this boilerplate project for kickstarting your web development endeavors.

# Prerequisites

-   Node v18+ [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

# Getting started

```shell
# Get the latest snapshot
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/imchamarac/jwt-auth-service.git <project_name>

# Change directory
cd <project_name>

# Copy the .env.example contents into the .env
cat .env.example > .env
```

There are two ways to go about running this project in your dev enviornment.
You can either follow the quick start path where you can use the docker-compose setup or you can setup the development enviornment by following the steps in dev setup.

## Quick start

Ensure you have docker installed on your machine or you can install it from [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).

You can simply run the `docker-compose up` command to build and runs the following required services.

-   **pgadmin** - Database administrator tool
-   **db** - PostgreSQL database
-   **app** - Express server instance

### pgAdmin server setup

Once docker compose is completed building process and starts running you can follow the below setps to setup the pgAdmin tool

-   Go to http://localhost:5050/browser/ in your browser.
-   Use the credentials under the pgadmin service in the docker compose file to login.
-   Once you're logged in, create a new server by right click on the Server -> Register -> Server
    -   **General tab** - provide the server name (any name)
    -   **Connection tab** - provide `db` as the host name/ address and fill password from the docker compose file
-   If you navigate to DB name(jwt_auth_service default) -> Schemas -> Tables -> users table should be available
-   Database is up and running and is ready to accept connections from our application.

### Test database

You can check the database service by running the following commands:

-   `docker exec -ti pg_server /bin/bash` - to start a interactive terminal inside the container.
-   `psql jwt_auth_service admin` - to log into the database with admin role.
-   `\dt` - to list avilable tables.
-   `SELECT * FROM users;` - to list users from the users table.

With that you now have access to your API üéâ üéâ üéâ üéâ

-   ##### Go to http://localhost:8080/login to visit the web application and you can start by registering a new user
-   ##### Go to http://localhost:8080/api/v1/docs/ to check the swagger docs
-   ##### Go to Postman and start sending API requests to listed endpoints in the swagger docs

## DEV setup

If you would like to run this project in dev mode to play around with the codebase, I recommend setting it up using the following steps.

### Setup PostgreSQL server

You can install postgreSQL by running:

`brew install postgresql`

Export the following environment variables from the root:

```
export PGUSER=admin
export PGPASSWORD=password
export PGDATABASE=jwt_auth_service
export PGHOST=localhost
export PGPORT=5432
```

The database schema and seed data is located inside the `db` folder.

Run following command to create database schema:

`psql -f ./db/schema.sql`

(optional) If you are planning to run integration tests:, run the following command to create a test database:

`psql -f ./db/schema-test.sql`

(optional) Run following command to seed the database:

`psql -f ./db/data.sql`

To run the migrations use the following command (after you have installed all packages):

`db-migrate up`

### Setup DBeaver(recommend)

You can skip this step if you already have a configured database admin tool, if not you can download and setup DBeaver to help you to visualize and manage your databases.

Once you created and connected to a server, you can start the application in your local environment

### Start dev server

Before start the dev server install dependencies by ruiing `yarn install`.

Once the installation is completed, you can start the application by ruuning `yarn dev`...

With that you now have access to your API with live reloading üî• üî• üî• üî•

# Debugging

Follow below steps if you want to run in the debug mode,

-   To start debug mode run `dev:debug` script.
-   Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and find the Debug: Attach to Node Process command from the command palette of VScode.
-   Now you can add breakpoints and send a request from the browser or from the postman.

# Logging

We're using following libraries to handle application's loggings

-   [Morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan) - to log incoming HTTP requests
-   [Winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) - to log application errors, info, warnings and debugging.

# Testing

This project uses [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) for unit tests, [Supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest) for integration tests and [Cypress](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress) for E2E tests the web pages.

## Integration tests with Supertest

We use a separate database to run integration tests so we can keep it clean after each tests.

If you haven't done already, run the following command to create a test database:

`psql -f ./db/schema-test.sql`

After creating the test database, you can run the following script to run integration tests

`test:integration`

## Unit tests with Jest

Run the following command to run unit tests:

`test:units`

## E2E tests with Cypress

Run the following command to run cypress tests:

`test:e2e`

# Code analysis and Fomatter

## Linting

This project is using `ESLint` with `typescript-eslint/recommended` settings for static code analysis.  
Run `lint:fix` to scan and fix(what's fixable) problematic patterns in your code.

## Formatting

This project is using `Prettier` for code formatting.
Run `prettier:fix` to scan and fix formatting issues.

# Documentaion

This project uses openapi 3 specification with swagger express UI to render the documents into `api/v1/docs` route.

Note that I've used two methods(inline and separate folder) to write docs and used jsDOC to switch and load them into the swagger express UI.

Feel free to use only one method that you prefer.
